      The Internet Systems Consortium DHCP Relay Agent, dhcrelay, provides a
      means for relaying DHCP and BOOTP requests from a subnet to which no DHCP
      server is directly connected to one or more DHCP servers on other subnets.
      It supports both DHCPv4/BOOTP and DHCPv6 protocols.

      AdGuard Home is a network-wide software for blocking ads & tracking. After
      you set it up, it’ll cover ALL your home devices, and you don’t need any
      client-side software for that. With the rise of Internet-Of-Things and
      connected devices, it becomes more and more important to be able to
      control your whole network.
