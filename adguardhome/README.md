The Internet Systems Consortium DHCP Relay Agent, dhcrelay, provides a means for
relaying DHCP and BOOTP requests from a subnet to which no DHCP server is
directly connected to one or more DHCP servers on other subnets. It supports
both DHCPv4/BOOTP and DHCPv6 protocols.

AdGuard Home is a network-wide software for blocking ads & tracking. After you
set it up, it’ll cover ALL your home devices, and you don’t need any
client-side software for that. With the rise of Internet-Of-Things and
connected devices, it becomes more and more important to be able to control
your whole network.
